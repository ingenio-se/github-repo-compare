# POST_ASSIGNMENT_ANSWERS

## Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them

Choice of Sentiment Analysis: Selected for its immediate value in providing insights into community sentiment, using established APIs for efficiency and reliability.

Chart.js for Data Visualization: Chosen for its simplicity and ability to create interactive, responsive charts, which are crucial for visualizing commit activity.

Modular API Client Design: Implemented to encapsulate external API interactions, ensuring a single responsibility principle and making the codebase scalable and easier to manage.

## How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

Learning Framework: 2 hours - Refreshing knowledge on React and familiarizing with Chart.js.

Coding: 3 hours - Writing the main functionalities, including API integration and UI components.

Debugging: 2 hours - Fixing issues related to API data handling, especially around the sentiment analysis integration and asynchronous data fetching.

Design and Refinement: 1 hours - Adjusting the UI and ensuring a user-friendly experience.

## If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

Plan Before Coding: Spend more time upfront planning the architecture and data flow. This can reduce the time spent on debugging and refactoring later.

Focus on MVP: Concentrate on building a minimum viable product first, then iterate with additional features. This helps in managing time and prioritizing essential functionalities.

Expect the Unexpected with APIs: Be prepared for potential inconsistencies and limitations in external APIs, especially when dealing with data like commits and sentiment analysis.

## Did you learn anything new?

Enhanced Understanding of Chart.js: Gained more experience in implementing and customizing charts for data visualization.

Improved API Integration Skills: Learned more about handling external APIs efficiently, especially in dealing with asynchronous operations and error handling in React.

Deeper Insights into Sentiment Analysis: While familiar with the concept, implementing it in a real-world project provided practical insights into its uses and limitations.

## Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

This assignment effectively showcased my abilities in React development, API integration, and building a functional, user-centric web application. It highlighted my problem-solving skills and my ability to learn and apply new technologies quickly.

## Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

Backend Development: Experience with server-side technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and database management, which was not required for this frontend-focused assignment.

Advanced State Management: Skills in managing complex application states using tools like Redux or Context API, which weren't necessary for the scope of this project.

Responsive Web Design: Although the project is responsive, it didn't fully demonstrate my skills in building highly responsive and mobile-first web designs.

Authentication and Security: Knowledge in implementing user authentication and maintaining web security, which were not part of this projectâ€™s requirements.
